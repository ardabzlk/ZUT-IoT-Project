# ZUT-IoT-Project
## Internet of Things course final homework project

In this project I have used ESP 8266 module and basic LED to show the basics of the WiFi microchip. I created my own website template for Graphical User Interface so that it allows user to control LED light without any cable or physical connection directly to the circuit. During this processes I used ESP8266WiFi and ESP8266WebServer libraries.
